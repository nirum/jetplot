# Description

`jetplot` provides helper functions for generating plots, color palettes, and simple signal utilities. The goal is to make it easier to produce publication quality figures with minimal code.

Key modules include:

- `colors`: utilities for working with custom color maps and palettes.
- `plots`: common plot helpers like ridge lines and covariance ellipses.
- `style`: helpers for configuring Matplotlib defaults.
- `signals` and `timepiece`: basic signal processing and time utilities.
